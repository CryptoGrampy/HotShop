# HotShop

## Welcome

Welcome to the HotShop. This is a huge work in progress and please use at your own risk (yes there is a demo site where you can play around!) !  Currently going through some major life things at the moment, but my current approach is throwing a lot of rough code out there, lots of TODOs smattered all over the place, getting things working in a clunky way and then focusing in, refactoring, cleaning things up, adding/removing features. Don't look at anything too closely yet as this is almost entirely a simple, functional proof of concept at the moment. 

Currently, I would say I'm finished with Milestone 1 for the Monero CCS. I'm able to generate payment QR's with an amount, and validate that they are being paid.  This is the core of the app; the code isn't where I'd like it to be quite yet on the backend, but it works, and that's what matters.

From here, I plan on adding a few more significant items- a numpad, a couple buttons, and then putting some serious polish on it before I would say milestone 2 is complete.  At that point, I will officially be sharing the project to the community for review and feedback.

You're welcome to demo the HotShop in it's really rough alpha state here: https://sunny-malabi-a3b5ff.netlify.app/  ; Any money paid to the default address will go straight to me, so thank you for your donation.  Otherwise, please feel free to enter your own primary address/view-key to test out the live tx validator AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Do not send more than test amounts please, and to the best of my knowledge, your primary and view keys should not be getting sent ANYWHERE outside of your browser at this moment in time (if that's not the case, please let me know :) )
